    "markdown": "# Overview\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a high level, our goal with `{epipredict}` is to make running simple machine learning / statistical forecasters for epidemiology easy. However, this package is extremely extensible, and that is part of its utility. Our hope is that it is easy for users with epidemiology training and some statistics to fit baseline models while still allowing those with more nuanced statistical understanding to create complicated specializations using the same framework.\n\nServing both populations is the main motivation for our efforts, but at the same time, we have tried hard to make it useful.\n\n\n## Baseline models\n\nWe provide a set of basic, easy-to-use forecasters that work out of the box. \nYou should be able to do a reasonably limited amount of customization on them. Any serious customization happens with the framework discussed below).\n\nFor the basic forecasters, we provide: \n    \n* Flatline (basic) forecaster \n* Autoregressive forecaster\n* Autoregressive classifier\n* Smooth AR forecaster\n\nAll the forcasters we provide are built on our framework. So we will use these basic models to illustrate its flexibility.\n\n## Forecasting framework\n\nAt its core, `{epipredict}` is a **framework** for creating custom forecasters.\nBy that we mean that we view the process of creating custom forecasters as\na collection of modular components. All of them should be easy to swap out\nor exchange for others, and massive variety should be available by fairly \nsimple modifications through the addition of steps or layers. \nThere are four types of components:\n    \n1. Preprocessor: make transformations to the data before model training\n2. Trainer: train a model on data, resulting in a fitted model object\n3. Predictor: make predictions, using a fitted model object and processed test data\n4. Postprocessor: manipulate or transform the predictions before returning\n    \nUsers familiar with [`{tidymodels}`](https://www.tidymodels.org) and especially \nthe [`{workflows}`](https://workflows.tidymodels.org) package will notice a lot \nof overlap. This is by design, and is in fact a feature. The truth is that\n`{epipredict}` is a wrapper around much that is contained in these packages.\nTherefore, if you want something from this -verse, it should \"just work\" (we hope).\n\nThe reason for the overlap is that `{workflows}` _already implements_ the first \nthree steps. And it does this very well. However, it is missing the \npostprocessing stage and currently has no plans for such an implementation. \nAnd this feature is important. The baseline forecaster we provide _requires_\npostprocessing. Anything more complicated (which is nearly everything) \nneeds this as well.\n\nThe second omission from `{tidymodels}` is support for panel data. Besides\nepidemiological data, economics, psychology, sociology, and many other areas\nfrequently deal with data of this type. So the framework of behind `{epipredict}`\nimplements this. In principle, this has nothing to do with epidemiology, and \none could simply use this package as a solution for the missing functionality in\n`{tidymodels}`. Again, this should \"just work\" (we hope).\n\nAll of the _panel data_ functionality is implemented through the `epi_df` data type\ndescribed in the previous part. If you have different panel data, just force it\ninto an `epi_df` as described in @sec-additional-keys.\n\n## Why doesn't this package already exist?\n\n-   Parts of it actually DO exist. There's a universe called `tidymodels`. It \nhandles pre-processing, training, and prediction, bound together, through a \npackage called workflows. We built `epipredict` on top of that setup. In this \nway, you CAN use almost everything they provide.\n-   However, workflows doesn't do post-processing to the extent envisioned here.\nAnd nothing in `tidymodels` handles panel data.\n-   The tidy-team doesn't have plans to do either of these things. (We checked).\n-   There are two packages that do time series built on `tidymodels`, but it's \n\"basic\" time series: 1-step AR models, exponential smoothing, STL decomposition,\netc.[^1] \n\n[^1]: Our group has not prioritized these sorts of models for epidemic \nforecasting, but one could also integrate these methods into our framework.\n\n\n## Show me the basics\n\nFor now, we'll just demonstrate one of the \"canned\" forecasters we provide: an autoregressive forecaster with (or without) covariates that _directly_ trains on the response. This is in contrast to a typical \"iterative\" AR model that trains to predict one-step-ahead, and then plugs in the predictions to \"leverage up\" to longer horizons. You saw this function in @sec-local-forecaster, but now we'll explain\nthe arguments a bit more thoroughly. Below, you'll see how to make a number of modifications to this\nforecaster, but understanding the inner workings, and **why** you would want\nsomething like this (as well as how to do elaborate customizations) \nwill be the subject of the rest of this book. \n\nWe'll use some of the same data we've examined earlier and estimate a model jointly across all locations using only the most recent 30 days of data (available\nin the built-in data frame).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='epipredict_cache/html/demo-workflow_c1aed8396eb1b411c4ab154ecd15e222'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njhu <- case_death_rate_subset %>%\n  filter(time_value >= max(time_value) - 30)\n\nout <- arx_forecaster(\n  jhu,\n  outcome = \"death_rate\",\n  predictors = c(\"case_rate\", \"death_rate\")\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n#> Warning: The forecast_date is less than the most recent update date of the\n#> data.forecast_date = 2021-12-31 while data is from 2022-05-31.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis call produces a warning, which we'll ignore for now.

The predictors and outcome can be changed \ndirectly. The rest of the defaults are encapsulated into a list of arguments. \nThis list is produced by `arx_args_list()`.\n\n## Simple adjustments\n\nBasic adjustments can be made through the `args_list`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='epipredict_cache/html/differential-lags_6b8588f2553c80d191c85d09836876f9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nout2week <- arx_forecaster(\n  epi_data = jhu,\n  outcome = \"death_rate\",\n  predictors = c(\"case_rate\", \"death_rate\"),\n  args_list = arx_args_list(\n    lags = list(case_rate = c(0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14), death_rate = c(0, 7, 14)),\n    ahead = 14\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nHere, we've used different lags on the `case_rate` and are now predicting 2 \nweeks ahead. Note that `lags` and `aheads` are in the same units as the \n`time_value` of the `epi_df` used for training (same as the `epi_slide()` \narguments discussed in @sec-sliding). This example also illustrates\na major difficulty with the \"iterative\" versions of AR models. This model \ndoesn't produce forecasts for `case_rate`, and so, would not have data to \n\"plug in\" for the necessary lags.[^2]\n\n[^2]: An obvious fix is to instead use a VAR and predict both, but this would \nlikely increase the variance of the model, and therefore, may lead to less \naccurate forecasts for the variable of interest.\n\n\nAnother property of the basic model is the predictive interval. We describe this in more detail in a coming chapter, but it is easy to request multiple quantiles.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='epipredict_cache/html/differential-levels_a9da683d7e7fef5e4cb6288ad9899809'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nout_q <- arx_forecaster(jhu, \"death_rate\", c(\"case_rate\", \"death_rate\"),\n  args_list = arx_args_list(\n    levels = c(.01, .025, seq(.05, .95, by = .05), .975, .99)\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe column `.pred_dstn` in the `predictions` object is actually a \"distribution\" here parameterized by its quantiles.
