    "markdown": "# Introducing the ARX forecaster\n\nThe ARX forecaster built-in to the `epipredict` package is an autoregressive forecasting model that is intended for `epi_df` data. This is a direct forecasting approach, which means that it will estimate a model for a particular target horizon. It is based upon the widely used autoregressive (AR) model, in which events in the future using a linear combination of events in the near past. An ARX model is an extension to the basic AR model where exogenous variables are included as predictors. Exogenous variables are incorporated as predictors into a forecasting model not because they are being predicted themselves, but because they add measurable value to it. So they are sometimes referred to as features or additional covariates. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIt can be quite the task to prepare exogenous variables for input into the model. For example, we may have to modify these variables match the temporal resolution of the variable being forecasted upon. In addition, there may be other considerations such as correlation or interaction between the exogenous variables. Since these are endeavours in feature selection and/or engineering, we will hold off on having that discussion here and instead reserve it for its own chapter.\n:::\n\nSimilar to the flatline forecaster, prediction intervals based on the quantiles of the residuals of the training data are obtained separately for each combination of keys (most commonly by `geo_value`). So as before the output is a data frame of point (optionally interval) forecasts at a single unique horizon (`ahead`) for each unique combination of keys. The ARX forecaster (using quantile regression) is comparable to the what the Delphi forecast team used for its COVID-19 forecasts over the course of the pandemic. \n\n## Example of using the ARX forecaster\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Load required packages\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-2_623477395faf9aaafb176ba4e3b9c817'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(epipredict)\nlibrary(workflows)\nlibrary(plotly)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### A brief re-introduction to the dataset\n\nIn our guided example using the ARX forecaster, we'll use the same `case_death_rate_subset` dataset that we used to showcase the flatline forecaster (that comes with the `epipredict` package) that is a subset of COVID-19 cases and deaths for US states and territories. To keep our example simple, we will only consider the data from Sept. 1, 2021 to Dec. 1, 2021.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-3_5fe7a023d12cc5c1a1aa3b196c654006'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njhu <- case_death_rate_subset %>%\n  dplyr::filter(time_value >= as.Date(\"2021-09-01\") & time_value <= \"2021-12-01\")\n\njhu\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> An `epi_df` object, 5,152 x 4 with metadata:\n#> * geo_type  = state\n#> * time_type = day\n#> * as_of     = 2022-05-31 12:08:25.791826\n#> \n#> # A tibble: 5,152 × 4\n#>   geo_value time_value case_rate death_rate\n#> * <chr>     <date>         <dbl>      <dbl>\n#> 1 ak        2021-09-01      75.3      0.198\n#> 2 al        2021-09-01     113.       0.845\n#> 3 ar        2021-09-01      68.5      0.919\n#> 4 as        2021-09-01       0        0    \n#> 5 az        2021-09-01      48.8      0.414\n#> 6 ca        2021-09-01      38.4      0.246\n#> # ℹ 5,146 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### The basic mechanics of the ARX forecaster\n\nSuppose that our goal is to predict death rates one week ahead of the last date available for each state as with the flatline forecaster. Mathematically, on day $t$, we want to predict new deaths $y$ that are $h$ days ahead at many locations $j$ using the death rate from today, 1 week ago, and 2 weeks ago. So for each location, we'll predict\n\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{j,{t+h}} = \\mu + a_0y_{j, t} +  a_7y_{j, t-7} + a_{14}y_{j, t-14}\n$$\n\nwhere $t$ is 2021-12-01, $h$ is 7 days, and $j$ is the state in our example. The $a_0$, $a_7$, and $a_14$ are the coefficients that are obtained from fitting a model to the training data.\n\nFrom the above, we can gather that the the `arx_forecaster()` function must have a predictors parameter in addition to a paramter for the data and the outcome. This is because there must be at least one predictor that is based on past values of the outcome. Hence, the simplest way to use the `arx_forecaster()` function to predict the death rate one week into the future, is to create an AR-type model. And to do this, we must input at minimum three arguments in the `arx_forecaster() function`: the `epi_df` data followed by the outcome of `\"death_rate\"`, and predictors of `\"death_rate\"`. As we can see in the above equation and from the `arx_args_list()` documentation) the default number of lags used for the predictors are 0, 7, and 14 days. In other words, what this forecaster aims to do is to predict the outcome (`death_rate`) one week ahead based on the predictor (`death_rate`) values from today, 1 week ago and 2 weeks ago.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-4_147a7744c4dfdacf6cee84849c167e75'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nar_one_week_ahead <- arx_forecaster(jhu, outcome = \"death_rate\", predictors = \"death_rate\")\nar_one_week_ahead\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> \n#> ══ A basic forecaster of type ARX Forecaster ════════════════════════════════\n#> \n#> This forecaster was fit on 2023-07-10 03:34:15\n#> \n#> Training data was an `epi_df` with\n#> • Geography: state,\n#> • Time type: day,\n#> • Using data up-to-date as of: 2022-05-31 12:08:25.\n#> \n#> ── Predictions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> \n#> A total of 56 predictions are available for\n#> • 56 unique geographic regions,\n#> • At forecast dates: 2021-12-01,\n#> • For target dates: 2021-12-08.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo make sure we understand exactly how the predictors were created from the training data (lags and all), we can compare the the molded/pre-processed training data that's contained in `one_week_ahead$epi_workflow$pre` to the raw training data.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_af8a1090e69c5be0b80ebc9b6c780f55'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncbind(\n  ar_one_week_ahead$epi_workflow$pre$mold$extras$roles$geo_value,\n  ar_one_week_ahead$epi_workflow$pre$mold$extras$roles$time_value,\n  ar_one_week_ahead$epi_workflow$pre$mold$predictors\n) %>%\n  head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#>   geo_value time_value lag_0_death_rate lag_7_death_rate lag_14_death_rate\n#> 1        ak 2021-09-15        0.2371631        0.1383451         0.1976359\n#> 2        al 2021-09-15        0.8591982        0.5718312         0.8446847\n#> 3        ar 2021-09-15        1.0370679        0.8155125         0.9192193\n#> 4        as 2021-09-15        0.0000000        0.0000000         0.0000000\n#> 5        az 2021-09-15        0.4889335        0.4350353         0.4138610\n#> 6        ca 2021-09-15        0.3450947        0.2565530         0.2456668\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's just focus on the first row for `ak` and filter the corresponding raw data for that `geo_value` and any dates before the `time_value` given (as we only need to consider lags here).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-6_2a950523774f34e286b5a9ebe9a31ed7'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\njhu %>% filter(geo_value == \"ak\" & time_value <= \"2021-09-15\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> An `epi_df` object, 15 x 4 with metadata:\n#> * geo_type  = state\n#> * time_type = day\n#> * as_of     = 2022-05-31 12:08:25.791826\n#> \n#> # A tibble: 15 × 4\n#>   geo_value time_value case_rate death_rate\n#> * <chr>     <date>         <dbl>      <dbl>\n#> 1 ak        2021-09-01      75.3      0.198\n#> 2 ak        2021-09-02      74.9      0.198\n#> 3 ak        2021-09-03      75.8      0.198\n#> 4 ak        2021-09-04      75.8      0.198\n#> 5 ak        2021-09-05      75.8      0.198\n#> 6 ak        2021-09-06      53.5      0.198\n#> # ℹ 9 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can then check whether the predictor values from the pre-processed data have been correctly taken from the raw data. For example, the `lag_0_death_rate` should be the `death_rate` on the `time_value` of 2021-09-15 for `ak` in the raw data. And indeed it is. Similarly, we can confirm that the `lag_7_death_rate` is the value from \"2021-09-08\" in the raw `jhu` data and the `lag_14_death_rate` is the value from \"2021-09-01\". In this way, we can manually check that the model used the correct predictor data if we're so inclined.\n\nNow that we are crystal clear on how the lags work, we can kick our model up a notch and go from an AR model to an ARX model by adding additional predictors (for any additional time-varying covariates that are being treated as exogenous variables).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_0d5bbaf45522cdd3138129509a66623d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narx_one_week_ahead <- arx_forecaster(jhu, outcome = \"death_rate\", predictors = c(\"death_rate\", \"case_rate\"))\narx_one_week_ahead\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> \n#> ══ A basic forecaster of type ARX Forecaster ════════════════════════════════\n#> \n#> This forecaster was fit on 2023-07-10 03:34:16\n#> \n#> Training data was an `epi_df` with\n#> • Geography: state,\n#> • Time type: day,\n#> • Using data up-to-date as of: 2022-05-31 12:08:25.\n#> \n#> ── Predictions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> \n#> A total of 56 predictions are available for\n#> • 56 unique geographic regions,\n#> • At forecast dates: 2021-12-01,\n#> • For target dates: 2021-12-08.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLike with the flatline model, the result is an S3 object that by default outputs a short summary of the training data and the predictions. The object itself contains three components, which are the metadata, the `epi_workflow`, and a tibble of predictions as usual. We should take note that from the summary we can see that the predictions are for the target date of Dec. 8, 2021, which is 7 days after the Dec. 1, 2021 forecast date (aka. the date on which the forecast was made). This implies that the 7 days is yet again the default for how many days the target date is ahead of the forecast date. And as we saw for the flatline forecaster, to change this, you must change the ahead parameter in the additional arguments list `arx_args_list()`. If you look at the help file for that function, you will see that the key difference between this list and that for the flatline forecaster is that  here there's a lags parameter that is for enumerating the lags for predictors in autoregressive-type models. And we can tailor the number of lags to the predictor. For some practice, we'll change the lags argument for each of our `case_rate` and `death_rate` predictors as well as the ahead value to 5 days.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_f5e8fd1f8809abb139cb9459c7545788'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narx_five_days_ahead_many_lags <- arx_forecaster(\n  jhu,\n  outcome = \"death_rate\",\n  predictors = c(\"death_rate\", \"case_rate\"),\n  args_list = arx_args_list(\n    lags = list(\n      case_rate = c(0, 1:7, 14, 21),\n      death_rate = c(0, 7, 14, 21)\n    ),\n    ahead = 5L\n  )\n)\narx_five_days_ahead_many_lags\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> \n#> ══ A basic forecaster of type ARX Forecaster ════════════════════════════════\n#> \n#> This forecaster was fit on 2023-07-10 03:34:18\n#> \n#> Training data was an `epi_df` with\n#> • Geography: state,\n#> • Time type: day,\n#> • Using data up-to-date as of: 2022-05-31 12:08:25.\n#> \n#> ── Predictions ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> \n#> A total of 56 predictions are available for\n#> • 56 unique geographic regions,\n#> • At forecast dates: 2021-12-01,\n#> • For target dates: 2021-12-06.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, instead of just inspecting the summary, we'll go a little deeper this time around and look into the `epi_workflow` as well as the pre-processing and post-processing operations that were carried out.\n\nThe `epi_workflow` is contains everything necessary to produce the predictions from pre-processing, to the model, to post-processing operations performed.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_0b4e1234cfbfe653d287df55b7235dba'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narx_one_week_ahead$epi_workflow\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n#> ══ Epi Workflow [trained] ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════\n#> Preprocessor: Recipe\n#> Model: linear_reg()\n#> Postprocessor: Frosting\n#> \n#> ── Preprocessor ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> 6 Recipe Steps\n#> \n#> • step_epi_lag()\n#> • step_epi_lag()\n#> • step_epi_ahead()\n#> • step_naomit()\n#> • step_naomit()\n#> • step_training_window()\n#> \n#> ── Model ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> \n#> Call:\n#> stats::lm(formula = ..y ~ ., data = data)\n#> \n#> Coefficients:\n#>       (Intercept)   lag_0_death_rate   lag_7_death_rate  lag_14_death_rate  \n#>         -0.013924           0.116500           0.124025           0.276121  \n#>   lag_0_case_rate    lag_7_case_rate   lag_14_case_rate  \n#>          0.001310           0.002376           0.002590  \n#> \n#> ── Postprocessor ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n#> 5 Frosting Layers\n#> \n#> • layer_predict()\n#> • layer_residual_quantiles()\n#> • layer_add_forecast_date()\n#> • layer_add_target_date()\n#> • layer_threshold()\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nLet's walk through the pre-processing that was done. The easy way to get this is to use `extract_preprocessor()` on the `epi_workflow` as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_0b752978a9fa400bd48fcde4ef889043'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nextract_preprocessor(arx_five_days_ahead_many_lags$epi_workflow)\n```\n:::\n\n\nUnder Operations, we can see that the pre-processing operations in the order they were carried out were to lag the death and case rates by the stated lags (`step_epi_lag()`), lead the death rate by 5 days (`step_epi_ahead()`), remove rows containing any NAs for the predictors or outcomes, and finally the number of recent observations used in the training window were not restricted (as in `step_training_window()` `n_training = Inf`). So, more was done here in comparison to the flatline forecaster. In particular, we now have steps to lag each of the predictor variables as well as to remove any rows containing a NA for any of the variables that make an appearance in the model.\n\nNext, let's have a brief look at the post-processing operations, which we can easily extract by using the `extract_frosting()` function on the `epi_workflow`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-11_19fe9ee9fd4c52ba5b6819d40d2f2fc9'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nextract_frosting(arx_five_days_ahead_many_lags$epi_workflow)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the post-processing operations were to create the predictions and the corresponding 90% prediction intervals, add the forecast and target dates and lower bound the predictions at zero.

The way we'll get the job done is to not impose an upper bound the data used in `hist` to make the death rate lines (so that we get all data available from our Sept. 2, 2021 start until the last date of Dec. 31, 2021).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-16_579614de5d067c1e3c156707ca8e42ce'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nhist <- case_death_rate_subset %>%\n  dplyr::filter(time_value >= as.Date(\"2021-09-01\")) %>% # No ub so we get up to the last date of Dec. 31, 2021\n  filter(geo_value %in% samp_geos)\n\nggplot(hist, aes(color = geo_value)) +\n  geom_line(aes(time_value, death_rate)) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  geom_errorbar(data = preds, aes(x = target_date, ymin = `0.05`, ymax = `0.95`)) +\n  geom_point(data = preds, aes(target_date, .pred)) +\n  geom_vline(data = preds, aes(xintercept = forecast_date)) +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d(name = \"\") +\n  scale_x_date(date_labels = \"%b %Y\") +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(geo_value)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"Incident deaths per 100K\\n inhabitants\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](arx-forecaster_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.svg){fig-align='center' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs our predictions get farther away from the forecast date, they don't seem unreasonable - sure they get increasingly questionable (as indicated by the larger prediction bands), but they are still not entirely unreasonable. Certainly they are more more sensible than the flatline forecaster (in which we simply propagated the last observation forward). The major philosophical difference between the two is that the ARX forecaster is built on the premise that the recent past is indicative of the future, whereas the flatline forecaster proceeds as though nothing but the single most recent instance is worthwhile for the future. And while we don't want to rule that out (it is possible), it is not usually something to base the future on; it is like saying that only what happened yesterday matters for today and for the rest of the month.\n\nIt is clear that the ARX forecaster is almost always more justifiable than the flatline forecaster to make farther-reaching predictions. And yet, however reasonable the long-term forecasts can seem, we should be careful to not overreach and make major long term predictions with a model that only uses data from the recent past. Such predictions have little to no practical value. So, in general, the ARX forecaster is more suited for short-term forecasts than for long-term forecasts and for instances where we think the future is well-represented by the past. For instance, if we expect there to be a period of major volatility coming up, but the past leading up to it has been relatively stable and uneventful, then a basic ARX model trained on the most recent past will not capture the upcoming insanity. In that case, amendments should be made and another model should be tried (though it may be hard to construct a good predictive model even in the best of such circumstances - in some cases it may be like trying to predict the unpredictable). This is an ever-present danger when modelling things like infectious diseases where there can be an explosion of cases or deaths rapidly and without much warning.\n\nTo wrap this up this discussion, let's visually inspect how our predictions change over time and how they may be geospatially related. To do this, we'll make a dynamic chloropleth plot using `plotly`.\n\nTo prepare the data, we must extract the quantiles that make up the 90% predictive intervals (nested inside `.pred_distn`).\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\" hash='arx-forecaster_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-17_948827f1ecc3c79eeb543c5245af8c45'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall_the_states_df <- out_df %>%\n  mutate(q = nested_quantiles(.pred_distn)) %>%\n  unnest(q) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = tau, values_from = q)\n```\n:::\n\n\nRemember the adapted \"Customize choropleth code\" that we introduced at the end of [Regression In Tidymodels - Part 2](tidymodels-regression-part2.qmd#sec-interactive-plot)? Well all we got to do is make a few select changes to that code to get a slider bar so that we may see what happens over time for each state. The two key changes to make to that code are to convert the target dates vector to a character vector (to be compatible with `plotly`) and to specify that frame is based on `target_date` when initializing the plotly-geo object (in `plot_geo()`). \nThat's all it takes.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"

can either hit play in the resulting plot and then sit back and watch what happens over time or you can manually slide the bar at the bottom across time and inspect the states of interest by hovering over them.\n\nA possible improvement to make to the above plot is to add the true death rates to it or to a similar plot that is positioned beside it. We'll leave this as an exercise to the reader that would like to take this opportunity to level up their skills.\n\n## What we've learned in a nutshell\n\nWhile the ARX forecaster is a simple model at it core, it is competitive with more complicated forecasters. So mastering the basics of this forecaster and equipping yourself with the knowledge to customize it can be a fantastic to have in your forecasting toolbox.\n",
